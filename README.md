# WebRTC Identity hackathon

Notes, code and pointers for the IETF Hackathon project "WebRTC Identity" at London IETF 101, March 2018

Instant comms channel: #webrtc on irc.w3.org

The following repos contain interesting code for the hackathon:

## CoSMo's code:

- https://github.com/CoSMoSoftware/idp
- https://github.com/CoSMoSoftware/idp-scaffolding
- modified appRTC using those IN PROGRESS

I (sergio) have put together some code to create a p2p server integrated with idp: https://github.com/CoSMoSoftware/idp-p2p<br><br>

I (sergio) have also setup so you can test it online easily: https://p2p-cosmo.ddns.net/ <br><br>

When testing with Firefox nightly I sometimes get an "unreadable" error on gUM, and I get sometimes an ice connection error which I have not yet been able to debug, but idp works.
